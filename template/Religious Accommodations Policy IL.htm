<p><span id="a185072" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Commitment to Equal Employment Opportunities</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a1026331" class="anchor"></span>{d.employeeName} complies with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Illinois Human Rights Act, and all applicable state and local fair employment practices laws, and is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs and practices or lack thereof. Consistent with this commitment, {d.employeeName} will provide a reasonable accommodation of an applicant's or employee's sincerely held religious belief if the accommodation would resolve a conflict between the individual's religious beliefs or practices and a work requirement, unless doing so would create an undue hardship for {d.employeeName} .</p>
<p><span id="a584522" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Requesting a Religious Accommodation</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a1026332" class="anchor"></span>If you believe you need an accommodation because of your religious beliefs or practices or lack thereof, you should request an accommodation from the {d.departmentName} Department. You may make the request orally or in writing. {d.employeeName} encourages employees to make their request in writing [on {d.employeeName} 's religious accommodation request form] and to include relevant information, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A description of the accommodation you are requesting.</p></li>
<li><p>The reason you need an accommodation.</p></li>
<li><p>How the accommodation will help resolve the conflict between your religious beliefs or practices or lack thereof and one or more of your work requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="a322352" class="anchor"></span>After receiving your oral or written request, {d.employeeName} will engage in a dialogue with you to explore potential accommodations that could resolve the conflict between your religious beliefs and practices and one or more of your work requirements. {d.employeeName} encourages you to suggest specific reasonable accommodations that you believe would resolve any such conflict. However, {d.employeeName} is not required to make the specific accommodation requested by you and may provide an alternative, effective accommodation, to the extent any accommodation can be made without imposing an undue hardship on {d.employeeName} .</p>
<p><span id="a362095" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Supporting Information</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a1026333" class="anchor"></span>{d.employeeName} may ask you to provide additional information about your religious practices or beliefs and the accommodation requested. If you fail to provide the requested information, your request for an accommodation may be denied.</p>
<p><span id="a136590" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Determinations</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a1026334" class="anchor"></span>{d.employeeName} makes determinations about religious accommodations on a case-by-case basis considering various factors and based on an individualized assessment in each situation.</p>
<p><span id="a335490" class="anchor"></span>{d.employeeName} strives to make determinations on religious accommodation requests expeditiously, and will inform the individual once a determination has been made. If you have any questions about an accommodation request you made, please contact [{d.position}/the {d.departmentName} Department].</p>
<p><span id="a1005787" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">No Retaliation</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a1026335" class="anchor"></span>Individuals will not be retaliated against for requesting an accommodation in good faith. {d.employeeName} expressly prohibits any form of discipline, reprisal, intimidation, or retaliation against any individual for requesting an accommodation in good faith.</p>
<p><span id="a638045" class="anchor"></span>{d.employeeName} is committed to enforcing this policy and prohibiting retaliation against employees and applicants who request an accommodation in good faith. However, the effectiveness of our efforts depends largely on individuals telling us about inappropriate workplace conduct. If employees or applicants feel that they or someone else may have been subjected to conduct that violates this policy, they should report it immediately to the {d.departmentName} Department. If employees do not report retaliatory conduct, {d.employeeName} may not become aware of a possible violation of this policy and may not be able to take appropriate corrective action.</p>
