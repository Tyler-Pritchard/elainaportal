<p><span id="a110498" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Hiring of Family Members</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a1023213" class="anchor"></span>Family members seeking employment at {d.employeeName} must use standard application channels. To avoid creating any barrier to equal employment opportunity, hiring of family members based exclusively on referrals will not be permitted.</p>
<p><span id="a1023214" class="anchor"></span>If the qualifications of any non-family member seeking employment are demonstrably superior to those of a family member of a current employee, the family member may not be considered for employment.</p>
<p><span id="a1023215" class="anchor"></span>{d.employeeName} is committed to an equal employment opportunity workforce. All hiring decisions of family members must be reviewed by the Human Resources department to ensure compliance with {d.employeeName} policies and applicable non-discrimination laws.</p>

<li><p>Employment.</p></li>
<li><p>Transfer or promotion.</p></li>
<li><p>Salary considerations.</p></li>
<li><p>Other management or personnel considerations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="a1023217" class="anchor"></span>Such influence may include, but is not limited to, participation as a member of a screening committee or other committee that recommends personnel actions or employment decisions of the related person.</p>
<p><span id="a1023218" class="anchor"></span>[Family members may not be employed within the same department without certification by Human Resources that the employment will not result in supervision of one family member over another.]</p>
<p><span id="a109027" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Change in Family Status</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a1023219" class="anchor"></span>If two employees marry, cohabit, or become otherwise related, so as to qualify as family members under this policy's definition, they must report the change in status to Human Resources[, which will work with the employees to devise a working solution to avoid nepotism problems under this policy].</p>
<p>[[Only one of the employees may be permitted to remain within the particular department[.]/The two employees may not remain in any reporting relationship where one has influence over the other[.]]</p>
<p>[unless accommodations can be made to eliminate the potential conflict.] [The choice of which employee will remain in the previous role and which will modify the role as necessary to be in compliance with this policy, is to be made by the two employees in question.]]</p>
<p><span id="a1023210" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">[Employees Covered Under a Collective Bargaining Agreement</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a1023220" class="anchor"></span>The employment terms set out in this policy work in conjunction with, and do not replace, amend, or supplement any terms or conditions of employment stated in any collective bargaining agreement that a union has with {d.employeeName} .
