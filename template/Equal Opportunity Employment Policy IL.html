<p>EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY POLICY (IL)</p>
<p><span id="a437557" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Equal Opportunity Employer</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a1028630" class="anchor"></span>{d.employeeName} is an equal opportunity employer and complies with all applicable federal, state, and local fair employment practices laws. {d.employeeName} strictly prohibits and does not tolerate discrimination against employees, applicants, or any other covered persons because of race, color, religion, creed, national origin or ancestry, ethnicity, sex, gender (including gender nonconformity and status as a transgender or transsexual individual), age, physical or mental disability, citizenship, past, current, or prospective service in the uniformed services/military status, genetic information, pregnancy, order of protection status, marital status, sexual orientation, unfavorable discharge from military service, arrest record, expunged or sealed convictions, status as a victim or perceived victim of domestic or sexual violence, or any other characteristic protected under applicable federal, state, or local law. All {d.employeeName} employees, other workers, and representatives are prohibited from engaging in unlawful discrimination. This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including, but not limited to, hiring, training, promotion, discipline, compensation, benefits, and termination of employment.</p>
<p><span id="a723781" class="anchor"></span>{d.employeeName} complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended by the ADA Amendments Act, the Illinois Human Rights Act (IHRA), and all applicable state and local law. Consistent with those requirements, {d.employeeName} will reasonably accommodate qualified individuals with a disability if such accommodation would allow the individual to perform the essential functions of the job, unless doing so would create an undue hardship. If you believe you need an accommodation, refer any such request to {d.departmentName} Department. {d.employeeName} will also, where appropriate, provide reasonable accommodations for an employee's religious beliefs or practices.</p>
<p><span id="a259069" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Complaint Procedure</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a1028631" class="anchor"></span>If you are subjected to any conduct that you believe violates this policy, you must promptly speak to, write, or otherwise contact your direct supervisor, the {d.departmentName} Department], your designated Human Resources representative, or a member of {d.employeeName} 's senior management team as soon as possible following the offending conduct. If you have not received a satisfactory response within five (5) days after reporting any incident of what you perceive to be discriminatory conduct, please immediately contact [{d.positionDepartmentName}{d.departmentName} Department]. These individuals will ensure that a prompt investigation is conducted. [Although not mandatory, a Complaint Form is available at [LOCATION] to make your complaint if you wish to use it.]</p>
<p><span id="a461952" class="anchor"></span>Your complaint should be as detailed as possible, including the names of all individuals involved and any witnesses. {d.employeeName} will directly and thoroughly investigate the facts and circumstances of all claims of perceived discrimination and will take prompt corrective action, if appropriate.</p>
<p><span id="a379093" class="anchor"></span>Additionally, any manager or supervisor who observes discriminatory conduct must report the conduct to Human Resources so that an investigation can be made and corrective action taken, if appropriate.</p>
<p><span id="a654278" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">No Retaliation</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a1028641" class="anchor"></span>No one will be subject to, and {d.employeeName} prohibits, any form of discipline, reprisal, intimidation, or retaliation for good faith reports or complaints of incidents of discrimination of any kind, pursuing any discrimination claim, or cooperating in related investigations. [For more information on {d.employeeName} 's policy prohibiting retaliation, please refer to {d.employeeName} 's Anti-Retaliation Policy or contact the {d.departmentName} Department.]</p>
<p><span id="a825770" class="anchor"></span>{d.employeeName} is committed to enforcing this policy against all forms of discrimination. However, the effectiveness of our efforts depends largely on employees telling us about inappropriate workplace conduct. If employees feel that they or someone else may have been subjected to conduct that violates this policy, they should report it immediately. If employees do not report discriminatory conduct, {d.employeeName} may not become aware of a possible violation of this policy and may not be able to take appropriate corrective action.</p>
<p><span id="a491024" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Violations of this Policy</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a1028632" class="anchor"></span>Any employee, regardless of position or title, whom Human Resources determines has subjected an individual to discrimination or retaliation in violation of this policy will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment.</p>
<p><span id="a345847" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Administration of this Policy</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a1028633" class="anchor"></span>The {d.departmentName} Department is responsible for the administration of this policy. If you have any questions regarding this policy or questions about discrimination, accommodations, or retaliation that are not addressed in this policy, please contact the {d.departmentName} Department.</p>
<p><span id="a982316" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">[Employees Covered Under a Collective Bargaining Agreement</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a1028634" class="anchor"></span>The employment terms set out in this policy work in conjunction with, and do not replace, amend, or supplement any terms or conditions of employment stated in any collective bargaining agreement that a union has with {d.employeeName} . Employees should consult the terms of their collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p><span id="a959611" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Conduct Not Prohibited by This Policy</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a1028635" class="anchor"></span>This policy is not intended to preclude or dissuade employees from engaging in legally protected activities/activities protected by state or federal law, including the National Labor Relations Act, such as discussing wages, benefits, or terms and conditions of employment, forming, joining, or supporting labor unions, bargaining collectively through representatives of their choosing, raising complaints about working conditions for their and their fellow employees' mutual aid or protection, or legally required activities.</p>
