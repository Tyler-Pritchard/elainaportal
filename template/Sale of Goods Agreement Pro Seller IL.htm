<p><strong>NOW, THEREFORE</strong>, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><span id="a661059" class="anchor"></span><span class="underline">Sale of Goods</span>. Seller shall sell to Buyer and Buyer shall purchase from Seller the goods set forth in the attached Exhibit A (the &quot;<strong>Goods</strong>&quot;) in the quantities and at the Prices (as defined in Section 7) and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.</p></li>
<li><p><span id="a77631" class="anchor"></span><span class="underline">Delivery</span>.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><span id="a338028" class="anchor"></span>The goods will be delivered within a reasonable time after the date of this Agreement, subject to availability of finished Goods. Seller shall not be liable for any delays, loss, or damage in transit.</p></li>
<li><p><span id="a767872" class="anchor"></span>Seller shall deliver the Goods to {d.sellerLocation} (the &quot;<strong>Delivery Point</strong>&quot;) using Seller's standard methods for packaging and shipping such Goods. Buyer shall take delivery of the Goods within {d.number} days of Seller's written notice that the Goods have been delivered to the Delivery Point. All Prices are [[EXW/OTHER INCOTERMS® RULE] Delivery Point, Incoterms® [YEAR OF APPLICABLE INCOTERMS® RULE]/[OTHER SHIPPING TERMS]].</p></li>
<li><p><span id="a1009497" class="anchor"></span>Seller may, in its sole discretion, without liability or penalty, make partial shipments of Goods to Buyer. Each shipment will constitute a separate sale, and Buyer shall pay for the units shipped whether such shipment is in whole or partial fulfillment of the quantity purchased under this Agreement.</p></li>
<li><p><span id="a284621" class="anchor"></span>If for any reason Buyer fails to accept delivery of any of the Goods on the date fixed pursuant to Seller's notice that the Goods have been delivered at the Delivery Point, or if Seller is unable to deliver the Goods at the Delivery Point on such date because Buyer has not provided appropriate instructions, documents, licenses, or authorizations: (i) risk of loss to the Goods shall pass to Buyer; (ii) the Goods shall be deemed to have been delivered; and (iii) Seller, at its option, may store the Goods until Buyer picks them up, whereupon Buyer shall be liable for all related costs and expenses (including, without limitation, storage and insurance).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><span id="a263259" class="anchor"></span><span class="underline">Non-Delivery</span>. The quantity of any installment of Goods as recorded by Seller on dispatch from Seller's place of business is conclusive evidence of the quantity received by Buyer on delivery unless Buyer can provide conclusive evidence proving the contrary. Seller shall not be liable for any non-delivery of Goods (even if caused by Seller's negligence) unless Buyer gives written notice to Seller of the non-delivery within three (3) days of the date when the Goods would in the ordinary course of events have been received. Any liability of Seller for non-delivery of the Goods shall be limited to delivering the Goods within a reasonable time or adjusting the invoice respecting such Goods to reflect the actual quantity delivered.</p></li>
<li><p><span id="a70995" class="anchor"></span><span class="underline">Quantity</span>. If Seller delivers to Buyer a quantity of Goods of up to 90% more or less than the quantity set forth in the attached Exhibit A, Buyer shall not be entitled to object to or reject the Goods or any portion of them by reason of the surplus or shortfall and shall pay for such Goods the Price set forth in this Agreement adjusted pro rata.</p></li>
<li><p><span id="a1003178" class="anchor"></span><span class="underline">Title and Risk of Loss</span>. Title and risk of loss passes to Buyer upon delivery of the Goods at the Delivery Point. As collateral security for the payment of the purchase Price of the Goods, Buyer hereby grants to Seller a lien on and security interest in and to all of the right, title, and interest of Buyer in, to, and under the Goods, wherever located, and whether now existing or hereafter arising or acquired from time to time, and in all accessions thereto and replacements or modifications thereof, as well as all proceeds (including insurance proceeds) of the foregoing.
