<p><span id="a000002" class="anchor"></span>[All romantic or dating relationships between employees are prohibited.</p>
<p><span id="a000003" class="anchor"></span><strong>OR</strong></p>
<p><span id="a000004" class="anchor"></span>No person in a management or supervisory position shall have a romantic or dating relationship with an employee whom he or she directly supervises or whose terms or conditions of employment he or she may influence (examples of terms or conditions of employment include promotion, termination, discipline, and compensation).</p>

<p><span id="a000008" class="anchor"></span>Romantic or dating relationships between employees are permitted, but only under the circumstances described by this policy.]</p>
<p><span id="a638659" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Prior Employee Relationships</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a000009" class="anchor"></span>To the extent possible, a supervisor or manager who has had a previous romantic or dating relationship with a subordinate or employee whose terms and conditions he or she may influence will not be involved in decisions relating to that individual's promotions, raises, termination, or other terms and conditions of employment.</p>
<p><span id="a499802" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Policy Protocols and Consequences</span></strong></p>

At the discretion of {d.employeeName} , in addition to or instead of demotion, one of the individuals involved in the relationship may be subject to transfer or termination of employment.
