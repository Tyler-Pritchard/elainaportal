There are both risks and benefits to accepting unsolicited ideas, so this is a good Policy to have. You can post it on your website when we’re done. Remember, if you want to go over risks and benefits and have this Policy tailored more to your industry needs, you can always schedule attorney time. I just have a two simple questions though, so let’s get started!
First, I need the legal name of your Company.  --></FONT>
[LEGAL NAME OF COMPANY] (the &quot;<FONT COLOR="#000000"><SPAN LANG="en-US"><B>Company</B></SPAN></FONT>&quot;)
receives many submissions proposing ideas for the Company's use and
commercialization. We appreciate this interest in the Company and
want to thank each person who has taken the time and effort to get in
touch with us. 
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.17in">Our policy,
however, is that the Company and its employees do not accept or
consider unsolicited ideas, suggestions, proposals, comments or
materials, including for new or improved products, services or
technologies, product or service enhancements, processes, advertising
campaigns, promotions, marketing plans or new product or service
names (collectively, &quot;Submissions&quot;). Please do not send any
Submissions in any form to the Company or any of its employees.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.17in">The sole purpose of
this policy is to avoid potential misunderstandings or disputes when
the Company's products, services, marketing or other projects might
seem similar to any Submissions made to the Company.</P>

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.17in">If, despite our
policy, you still submit your ideas to the Company, the following
terms shall apply to your Submissions, regardless of what your
communication states. You agree that:

in any manner, without compensation to you or any other person or

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-top: 0.17in">3.	The Company
shall have no obligations concerning the Submissions, including no
obligation to review the Submissions, return any materials, or
acknowledge receipt of the Submissions.</P>
