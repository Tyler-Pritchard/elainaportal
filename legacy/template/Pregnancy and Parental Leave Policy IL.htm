<p><span id="a000006" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Administration of this Policy</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a000007" class="anchor"></span>The {d.departmentName} Department is responsible for the administration of this policy. If you have any questions regarding this policy or if you have questions about pregnancy or parental leave that are not addressed in this policy, please contact the {d.departmentName} Department.</p>
<p><span id="a000008" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Procedures</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a000009" class="anchor"></span>If you need to take parental leave for the birth of your child or to care for a new adopted or foster child, you should provide advance notice to your supervisor or the {d.departmentName} Department. When possible, you should give at least 30 days' notice of your request for leave. If 30 days' notice is not possible because of medical necessity or for other reasons, you should give as much advance notice to {d.employeeName} as possible.</p>
<p><span id="a000010" class="anchor"></span>Written notice is preferred, but not required.</p>
<p><span id="a000011" class="anchor"></span>If you are suffering from a pregnancy-related disability and require reasonable accommodation (which may include leave) for this purpose, please speak with {d.departmentName} to discuss a reasonable accommodation. You may be required to submit medical certification of your disability.</p>
<p><span id="a000013" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Eligibility Requirements</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a000014" class="anchor"></span>[All employees are eligible for {d.number} [weeks/months] of paid parental leave.</p>
<p><span id="a000024" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Compensation During Leave</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a000025" class="anchor"></span>[Pregnancy and parental leave is unpaid. However, employees may use any or all of their accrued but unused vacation or other paid time off during their pregnancy or parental leave.</p>
<p><span id="a000026" class="anchor"></span><strong>OR</strong></p>
<p><span id="a000027" class="anchor"></span>During pregnancy and parental leave, employees will be paid [PERCENTAGE]% of their normal rate of pay for [LENGTH OF TIME]. Employees also may use any or all of their accrued but unused vacation or other paid time off during their pregnancy and parental leave. In no case can the use of paid leave time result in an employee's receipt of more than 100% of salary.</p>
<p><span id="a000030" class="anchor"></span>[Short-term disability insurance is also available for pregnancy leave. Please see {d.departmentName} for information about short-term disability insurance, including eligibility requirements.]</p>
<p><span id="a000032" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Benefits During Leave</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a000033" class="anchor"></span>During pregnancy and parental leave, all benefits provided under an employee benefit plan are governed by the terms and conditions of the applicable employee benefit plan documents in accordance with applicable law. For all other benefits, an employee on pregnancy or parental leave will receive the same rights and benefits as employees on [a paid/an unpaid] leave of absence.</p>
<p><span id="a000035" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Reemployment</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a000036" class="anchor"></span>Your job will be held for you in accordance with applicable law while you are on pregnancy or parental leave.</p>
<p><span id="a000037" class="anchor"></span>If you are on pregnancy-related disability leave, when you are able to return to work, you must submit a doctor's certification stating you are medically able to return to your normal duties. Your continued absence from work beyond your required disability leave period (as determined by your physician) and exhaustion of all other available leave may be deemed a voluntary abandonment of your job.</p>
<p><span id="a000038" class="anchor"></span>Nothing in this policy requires {d.employeeName} to reemploy individuals who are not eligible for reemployment rights under applicable law.</p>
<p><span id="a000040" class="anchor"></span><strong><span class="underline">Discrimination and Retaliation Prohibited</span></strong></p>
<p><span id="a000041" class="anchor"></span>{d.employeeName} prohibits and will not tolerate discrimination or retaliation against any employee or applicant because of that person's pregnancy or parental leave. Specifically, no one will be denied employment, reemployment, promotion, or any other benefit of employment or be subjected to any adverse employment action based on that person's pregnancy or parental leave. In addition, no one will be disciplined, intimidated, or otherwise retaliated against because that person exercised rights under this policy or applicable law.</p>
<p><span id="a000042" class="anchor"></span>{d.employeeName} is committed to enforcing this policy against discrimination and retaliation. However, the effectiveness of our efforts depends largely on employees telling us about inappropriate workplace conduct. If employees feel that they or someone else may have been subjected to conduct that violates this policy, they should report it immediately. If employees do not report such conduct, {d.employeeName} may not become aware of a possible violation of this policy and may not be able to take appropriate corrective action.</p>
